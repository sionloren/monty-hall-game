**Problem description:**

Assume that you are attending a TV show where you can win money by picking the right box. The game show host shows you three boxes explaining that the money is in one of the boxes. He asks you to pick one of them without opening it. After you have picked one of the boxes he opens one of the other two boxes which is empty. Now he turns to you and asks, do you want to change your mind, picking the remaining box?


**Task:**

Write a readable and maintainable program in Java randomly simulating this event over and over again in the quest of answering following question. Do I stand a better chance to win if I change my mind? Maven should be used. The only assumption allowed is that three boxes exist.
